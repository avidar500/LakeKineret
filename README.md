# LakeKineret
This project aims to find the correlations between rainfall in different locations in Israel and change in the level of lake Kineret (Sea of Gelilee).
The project also compares different lag times between rainfall and the change in the level of the lake to find the lag that gives the best
correlation. The repository contains the notebook coded in Python, 3 databases (2 downloaded from Israel Meterological Service (IMS) and one from Kineret.org)
and this Readme file.

Studying with DataCamp online courses enabled me to execute this project in Python. The knowledge I acquired from these courses is invaluable
and opened me a window to the world of data science. I highly recommend these courses to anyone interested in this field.
